with the help of the classification table.

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.7cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">The program reads the selected
files and creates an Excel file with the evaluation results and
various diagrams. The user can select several files for the
evaluation, but all raw files must be located in the same folder. The
storage location of the results can be set in the preferences menu.</font></p>

<h2 class="western" align="left">How
does the program work?</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">The user interface is quite
intuitive.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">
Pressing the menu icon in the header line opens up the main menu. There you will find information about the program, the possibilities of supporting via a donation and the preferences submenu. In the settings sub-menu, the folders for storing the results and lcoation of the classification table can be selected and stored. In addition, since version 3.01 it is possible to switch between English and German and to select different currency symbols for the display of results.
From version 3.04 on, it is also possible to define accounts by name in the settings menu. If this setting is selected, the imported raw files can be assigned to an account and thus different accounts of the same bank can be processed separately
(see also Why do I need account names?).</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">
The main window is clearly arranged and offers the possibility to select and deselect the desired evaluation settings with a few clicks. The top line contains the switch button for selecting the data type of the raw data to be read in. You can import csv or Excel(xlsx) files (in KYSA format).</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">
Csv files must have been exported from one of the accounts listed above and can then be prepared and evaluated. If your account type is not in the above list, I can include it, if desired, in one of the next versions. The best way to do this is to upload the csv file of the respective account without any personal information (transactions/names/account numbers) via the installed Nextcloud-Upload. You'll find more information on that on the <a href="https://digital-souveraenitaet.de/kysa-know-your-spendings-english">KYSA website</a>.
</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">The Excel file button should
only be selected if a csv file has already been evaluated and the
resulting file has been manually re-adjusted, e.g. to manually assign 
categories afterwards. When selecting the Excel file, an Excel file
must therefore be available in the KYSA-specific format of a previously created
"Excel_evaluated" file.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the choice between
csv and xlsx, it is also possible to select whether vacations should
be evaluated separately, whether Roundies (Rounded pennies)
should be included or whether individual files should be merged (csv raw data can also be merged with existing Excel result files in KYSA-specific format.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">
Since version v2.04, it is also possible to link a manually managed budget book (Excel format) with the cash withdrawals of the accounts.
If no account names are used, the bank account type must be entered in the budget book under "Account name" (e.g. Comdirect current account). Otherwise, the account name must be entered there.
</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">
Since version v3.04, KYSA also stores all raw files ever imported under the the respective account name, if one has been selected. If no account names have been defined, the raw files are stored under the bank account type (if readable during the import process). The storage
is encrypted in the KYSA folder. The main window offers the possibility to evaluate these stored data records, as well as to link them with new imported files and to output them.
</font></p>
<h2 class="western" align="left">How does the category assignment work?</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">Since version 3.04 classification works twofold. At first, each individual entry is checked for the search words defined by the user in the classification table (Search words tab). The folder in which the classification table is located can be specified the settings menu. The name of the classification table must not be changed. <br>
If a search word is found in the booking text, this booking will be assigned to the corresponding category. If no matching search word is found, the first classification mechanism returns "unclear" as the category. <br><br>
In a second step, all categories are then assigned to the respective main categories according to the assignment specification in the "Main categories" tab of the classification table. "Unclear" categories are assigned to the main category "category proposed by machine". The assignment of "unclear" categories must not be changed because it is necessary for the second classification mechanism.<br><br>
In this second classification mechanism, the KYSA takes an attempt to sort the "unclear" categories using a learning algorithm based on past revenue categorizations. Since KYSA was developed to be data-sparsing, there is no server-based database to get transaction informations from. This means that the second classification mechanism is pretty "dumb" at the beginning. However, KYSA "learns" with each Excel file (in KYSA format) that is read in. <br>
This in turn means that as a user, you should carefully review all categories under the main category "category proposed by machine" to ensure that KYSA learns the correct relationship between booking text&transaction and the resulting category. 
Especially for the first KYSA uses it therefore makes sense to check the transactions carefully. Firstly to define keywords for recurring transactions in the classification table. Secondly, the correction of the proposed categories and the re-evaluation of this corrected Excel-file not only leads to more accurate evaluations and diagrams, but also helps that the proposed categories get better and better over time. <br><br>
If you want to enforce fixed category assignments, you should define a unique search word in the classification table (search words tab) that is regularly found in the transactions texts. Since version v3.04, upper and lower case letters, punctuation and stopwords ("the", "and", "it"...) are irrelevant for the classification. <br><br>
The category corresponding to the search word can be freely selected. However, you have to remember that not too many characters should be used, otherwise the diagrams will become confusing. However, the display of long category names in the diagram can be improved by entering them in the classification table with a forced line break (ALT+Enter) in the cell.<br> 
Moreover, as of version v3.04, each new category should also be assigned to a main category (main categories table tab) in order to obtain meaningful results. If this assignment is not done, the new category will be sorted into the main category "unknown categories".  <br><br>
If you want to use the function "Extract vacations", the word &quot;holiday&quot;,“vacation“ or „trip“ (note lower case writing) must appear
in one of the categories in the classification table. In addition, the main categories "investments &amp; retirement prov.", "living &amp; big
purchasess" and "vacations &amp; travel" are stored in the script for calculation steps and may not be removeda, as well as the line belonging to the main category "category proposed by machine". If categories are used that can be assigned to one of these main categories, you should link them in the main categorization logic (table tab main catories).</font></p>

<h2 class="western" align="left">Why do I need account names?</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">
In the Settings menu, account names can be defined. This makes sense if you have several accounts at the same bank and want to evaluate and save them separately. With these account names you can assign entries in the budget book directly to an account. <br>
If no account names are defined, KYSA saves new raw data automatically under the name of the corresponding bank account type. If you have several accounts with the same bank this means that these are summarized and can not be evaluated separately again. <br><br>

If only one account is used at one bank, no account names need to be defined.
<h2 class="western" align="left">Extract vacations to separate file</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, all data entries assigned to the main category "vacations &amp; travel" are additionally merged from all imported (or saved) data files into a
separate file. This file is also evaluated and presented in an Excel
file and diagrams. This function is not applied to data that has been
created by merging.</font></p>

<h2 class="western" align="left">Output Roundies (Rounded pennies)</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, the rounding amounts of the
individual transactions are added from all account files to be
imported and merged in a separate file. Afterwards the amount of savings from penny
roundings is displayed according to the respective account they originate form and illustrated in a column diagram.
Thus it is quickly visible, how much money could be taken quite simply from the account, if all transaction amounts were to be rounded to the full euro. This function is not applied to data that
has been created through merging of separate files.</font></p>

<h2 class="western" align="left">Merge
files </h2>
<h3 class="western" style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.6cm"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt">1)
Merge single files</font></h3>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.4cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can select the option to
merge individual raw data
files into a separate file and then evaluate this file as a whole. If
this option is selected, after a successful data import you will be
asked which files are to be merged and what name the new file(s)
should have. As a result, an Excel file and some diagrams for each
new file are stored in the result folder with your chosen file name. If csv raw files are to be linked with existing Excel files, this option must be selected separately.</font></p>
<h3 class="western" style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.6cm"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt">2)
Link csv data with existing Excel-results</font></h3>
<p><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">The result of the account
evaluation is always an Excel file. If you want to add the evaluation
results of csv raw files (e.g. over a different period of time) to
existing Excel files and evaluate them as a whole, select this
option. If this option is selected, the existing Excel file(s) to
which data is to be added are selected after successful data import.
These file(s) must be in the KYSA Excel-format, otherwise the
procedure will not work. <br/>
After a successful import of this file
you can choose in a simple matrix which files should be merged and
which name this new file(s) should have. As a result, a new
Excel file and some diagrams for each new file are stored in the
folder with the file name.</font></p>

<h2 class="western" align="left">Cashbook</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">Cash expenditures can be entered
separately in the cashbook, so that they can be linked to the account data. This feature helps you to better understand your cash transactions, because your account data records only the cash withdrawals, not exactly what the money was spent on. <br><br>
It is important for the analysis of the cashbook to  comply with the formatting and input requirements in the &quot;description&quot;
worksheet. This is the only way to extract the relevant data and link it to the account data. For each imported (or saved) account, the program
checks whether data exists for the cash category specified in the cashbook. If this is the case, those entries in the cashbook with a date lying within the considered time period of the respective account will be added to this dataframe. The added
entries are automatically offset against the total amount of the specified cash category. The remaining amount then shows the cash expenditure
not being described through the additional information in the cashbook.
If data for the account type exists but KYSA wasn't able to link data points, a note
with error codes (see chapter Error Codes) will be displayed.<br><br>
Since version v3.04, you can be specify the account in the budget book by its account name (defined in the preferences menu). This ensures that only this account will be credited with the respective cash payment. If no account names are used, the bank account types can be used as fallback level (see description tab in cashbook.xlsx).
</font></p>

<h2 class="western">Evaluate and output stored long-term data</h2>
<p><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">From version v3.04 on, KYSA stores all of your imported data files with the respective account name.
If no account names have been defined, the the bank account types will be used as account names. The data is stored encrypted and adjusted for double entries. With the function "Evaluate and output stored long-term data of the accounts" the stored data records can be evaluated and outputted. In doing so, a data record is prepared for each account name, which is also included in the selected vacation, roundies or cashbook analysis, and is outputted as "Long-term_account name". This feature is not selectable as long as no data has been saved.
</font></p>

<h2 class="western" align="left" style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Select
files</h2>
<p><font face="Helvetica, sans-serif">Here you can select the raw files
