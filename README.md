# KYSA

Know Your Spendings Application. 6 account types supported, GTK-GUI established. Required modules can be found in the requirements.txt and installed via pypi(pip). 

Leightweight standalone program to analyse *csv-exported account transactions and sort them into categories based on the classification table (different for German and English). The software returns categorized data as well as various diagrams to get the jist of the data content. Interaction language is german as well as the supported accounts. See also the manual (KYSA Readme.html) for further details.

Since Version 2.04 a new feature is implemented to link csv-data to manually recorded cash transactions in a separate Excel list ("cashbook"). Furthermore preferences can now be saved for the next session.

Future work will include account data saving and machine learning. If you wish to help me, please give me a message. Any help is appreciated! I'm collecting account raw data csv-files for integration in future releases via a Nextcloud upload: https://krezdorn.next-cloud.org/index.php/s/zkB5Ro5GHjRdxi4.
If you upload you csv-file, please make sure to delete any personal information (account number, names, transactions etc.)
